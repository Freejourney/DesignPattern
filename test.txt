Recently, Professor ZHANG Meiyun's team of the College of Light Industry Science and Engineering published a research paper entitled "Timesaving, High-Efficiency Approaches to Fabricate Aramid Nano fibers" in the International Journal of Materials, "ACS Nano". (ACS Nano, DOI: 10.1021/acsnano. 9b02258.). Our university is the only communication unit of the thesis. YANG Bin, a youth teacher of the College of Light Industry Science and Engineering, is the first author and correspondent of the paper and Professor ZHANG Meiyun is the co-author of the communication. Professor ZHANG Meiyun's team has been committed to the development of high-performance paper-based functional materials for many years, and has made important progress in the field of functional fiber materials and paper-based Nano composites.
